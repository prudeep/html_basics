On the other hand, the Kia Seltos prioritizes a more futuristic and tech-centric approach, featuring a large infotainment screen, customizable ambient lighting, and an array of advanced driver assistance systems. While both interiors are well-executed, buyers may find themselves drawn to one over the other based on their individual preferences for design aesthetics and technological features.

</p>
<p>In summary, the Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos are both compelling choices in the compact SUV segment, offering a blend of style, performance, and features at competitive price points.
